### 4. Success Criteria

The success of the automated classification system will be measured using both technical performance metrics and practical outcomes:

#### Technical Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: Achieve at least **90% accuracy** on a held-out test set of labeled articles.
2. **F1-Score**: Attain a minimum **macro-averaged F1-score of 0.88** to ensure balanced performance across all categories.
3. **Per-Class Performance**: Ensure no category has an F1-score below **0.85** to prevent bias toward dominant classes.
4. **Processing Time**: Classify an article in **under 2 seconds** in the deployed system.

#### Practical/Business Metrics
1. **Reduction in Manual Categorization Time**: Decrease editorial classification workload by at least **50%** compared to the current manual process.
2. **Improved Consistency**: Maintain classification agreement of **90% or higher** with domain experts.
3. **Editor Satisfaction**: At least **80%** of editorial staff report improved efficiency and reduced workload during pilot testing.
4. **Scalability**: Handle **5x the current average submission volume** without performance loss.
