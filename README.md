# jabs_article_classification
Group Project for CSC4792 - Classifying JABS journal articles using title and abstract.

## **1. Problem Statement**  
The University of Zambia *Journal of Agriculture and Biomedical Sciences* **(UNZA-JABS)** is a quarterly Journal open to journal article publication in the fields of **agriculture, medicine, veterinary medicine and biomedical sciences as well as such allied life sciences**. The Journal welcomes manuscripts submissions that meet the general criteria of significance and scientific excellence. Currently, the classification of submitted articles into these categories is performed manually by editors or reviewers, which introduces several challenges:  

- **Time-Consuming Process**: Manual categorization requires significant editorial effort, delaying publication timelines.  
- **Subjectivity and Human Error**: Different reviewers may classify the same article differently based on their expertise, leading to inconsistencies.  
- **Scalability Issues**: As the number of submissions grows, manual classification becomes unsustainable.  

To address these challenges, we propose developing an **automated machine learning (ML)-based classification system** that uses **article titles and abstracts** to predict the correct discipline. This system will improve efficiency, reduce bias, and enhance the journalâ€™s ability to organize and index articles effectively.
